This was a project done in two weeks as a group to create an online e-commerce store of our choice.
It was most of the contributors first time working in Agile Development. 

The project was made with the use of **React, React-Redux, Node, JavaScript, Webpack,** and an assortment of libraries for testing and all we needed to get the website to properly function. 

We deployed on **Heroku**: [https://boiling-oasis-70615.herokuapp.com] and used **codeship** to verify that each build worked properly

Thanks for checking this out! :grinning:
